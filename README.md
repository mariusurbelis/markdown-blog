# Markdown Blog
The idea is to have a simple solution to dynamically generate a blog from a single folder of markdown files (blog posts).

The homepage would feature a list of clickable posts which once clicked would take the user to the individual post page featuring almost nothing else than the rendered markdown file itself.

The goal of this project is to have an easily deployable, migratable and clean blog.
